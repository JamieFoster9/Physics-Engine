This is an innovation project for my dissertation as a student of the university of chester

My project is to create a Soft Body Dynamics and Fracture Mechanics Physics Engine

This project showcases a physics engine implemented in C++ that simulates soft body dynamics and fracture mechanics using a mass-spring system.

Features:
Soft Body Dynamics: The engine can simulate the behavior of deformable solids, allowing objects to bend, stretch, and deform realistically.
Fracture Mechanics: Objects can fracture and break apart dynamically based on material properties and applied forces, leading to realistic fracture propagation.
Mass-Spring System: The physics simulation is based on a mass-spring system, where particles are connected by springs to model the behavior of materials.

Execute the compiled program to run the physics engine demo and visualize soft body dynamics and fracture mechanics in action.
